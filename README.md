# grading-training-exercise

During our workshop, we will: 

-- Think critically about how we write feedback 

-- Critique Feedback 

-- Practice writing our own feedback

The qmd in this repo has an example student answer the following question below. It also has feedback to the student answer, a space for you to write your own feedback, as well as document any notes you may want to take about feedback strategies. 


The question topic is around the permutation technique used to conduct a hypothesis test with 1 explanatory categorical variable and 1 quantitative response variable. Learning objectives around this topic include a complete understanding of the following: 

-- Understanding that, under the assumption of the null hypothesis, we assume independence between groups and are justified to use permutation techniques that shuffle all observations together 

-- and redistribute observations into two new groups of size n1 and n2. 

-- Then, take the new mean of each group, and subtract the new means in the same order as your sample statistic. 

-- Repeat this process many times to create a permutation distribution to conduct a hypothesis test.

**The question prompt is as follows**: 

Question on Simulation: *In as much detail as possible, DESCRIBE the simulation scheme for*

*(a) conducting a hypothesis test for evaluating whether the average air pollution are different between the United States and Canada.*

**Solution** 

**Take all air pollution values from US and Canada, and mix them all together. Randomly shuffle observations into new US and Canada groups of the same sizes as the original US (842) and Canada group (155). Next, take the mean air pollution for each group, and subtract them. Do this process a large amount of times to create a null distribution.**
